##User Stories & Wireframes
Both of these are available at our group Trello Board: https://trello.com/b/ycwVZYKo/team-turing

##Explanation of App
The app allows users to create custom surveys and then view the collected responses on a Dashboard. A new user is first prompted to register a username and password where as a returning user can login (if expired session). From the Dashboard view, users have the following options: create new surveys, add questions to a survey, edit questions within an existing survey, delete a question from a survey, and delete an entire survey.

There are three different types of questions:
1. Multiple Choice - a user creates a question title and a list of 5 options for the survey taker to select a single choice.
2. Scale - a user creates a question title and all questions display options ranging only from 1-5.
3. Text - a user creates a question title and the survey taker is given a text field to compose an answer, rather than selecting from a list.

##Future Features
1. Being able to add a question to an existing survey
2. Giving ownership of surveys to a particular User, so only the User sees their surveys.
